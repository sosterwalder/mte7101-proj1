Meeting minutes 2015-12-06
==========================

Presentation and discussion of the current state of the work (SO)
-----------------------------------------------------------------

* The progress is still slowed down a lot unfortunately. This is mostly
  due to an illness as well as work related issues. (SO)

  * This is ok, it was originally planned to have some breaks in the first
    three weeks of December. Those weeks were so to say spent already during
    November, so the work needs to be kept up during December. (CF)
  * Currently there are no further aspects that need special attention. (CF)
  * Make sure to commit also little progress at least to the Git repository,
    even when not updating the versioning table of the document. This makes
    progress visible, even if it is not finished yet. Keep that up on a weekly
    basis. If no progress has been made, e.g. due to illness, inform by e-mail
    that no progress has been made during a week, so that unnecessary effort
    may be kept at a minimal level. (CF)

* Effort has been but into re-generating the images as the currently used tool
  (Geogebra) leads to quick results, but makes it difficult to generte accurate
  images (e.g. all vectors need to have the same length and so on). First, IPE
  was used as a replacement, but seems not to be suited as it seems to be
  limited to basic operations. Second, Inkscape was which provde to be very
  usedful/handy. But due to the fact, that most of the work was done during the
  illness, the sources were unfortunately not saved, only the bitmap formats
  which prevents (re-) editing. Therefore the decision was made to generate the
  images using asymptote.

  * If any help using asymptote is needed, feel free to ask at any time. (CF)

* An introduction for the theoretical background was provided, a chapter about
  shading models was added. (SO)

* The timetable was completely re-worked. (SO)

Further steps/proceedings (CF, SO)
----------------------------------

* Meetings
  The next meeting will be arranged by e-mail by Sven Osterwalder as needed.
  At the current stage of the project - which mainly consists of re-arrangement
  and correction work - it is not useful to keep up a high-frequent
  meeting-schedule. Mr. Fuhrer has the first week in January 2016 off, so a
  meeting in real life may be scheduled then
* Process TODOs
* Expand basic chapters about illumination models according to TODOs
* Expand chapters "scope" and "administrative"
* Re-work introduction
* Add management summary

TODO for the next meeting
=========================

* Present the current state of the work (SO)
* Discuss the current state of the work (CF, SO)
* Define further steps/proceeding (CF, SO)

Scheduling of the next meeting
