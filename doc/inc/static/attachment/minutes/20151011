Meeting minutes 2015-10-11
==========================

Presentation and discussion of the current state of the work
------------------------------------------------------------

Theoretical background
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Local illumination models
    * Phong model, equation 5.2 (CF)
      * The notation of L_{j} and L_{j}^{'} is nearly not distinguishable due
        to the vector arrows. Use another notation to distinguish them.
        (DONE)
      * k_d and k_s dependen on the wave length resp. the color, this should
        be expressed as well
        (DONE)
      * The vectors L_{j} and L_{j}^{'} are normalized unit vectors
        (DONE)
      * The exponent 'n', as used in the legend, is missing in the equation
        (DONE)
      * An image of the situation could be added for better understanding
        (TODO, added)

* Global illumination models
  * Rendering equation, 5.3 (CF)
    * Add the correct reference, either to Kajiya or another source
      (TODO, added)
    * Spell the letter 's', used for the integral as well as for the
      explanations, always the same case, either upper or lower
      (DONE)
    * Use \varepsilon instead of \epsilon as this increases the readablity
      (DONE)
    * Do not use tables for the explanation to an equation as LaTeX may break
      the layout then
      (DONE)

* Ray casting
  * Is the description of ray casting developed enough? (SO)
    * No, the description should be further expanded, also formulas should be
      considered and added, as well as examples (CF)
      (TODO, added)
  * Is the pseudo code of ray casting developed enough? (SO)
    * Yes, the pseudo code is developed enough, although the unnecessary
      spaces of the lstlisting environment could be removed using the columns
      parameter with the fullflexible value (CF)
      (DONE)

* Ray tracing
  * Is an explanation of transmission and refraction needed? (SO)
    * Yes, an explanation of those terms would be good (CF)
    (TODO, added)
  * The reference when referring Whitted's publication is missing(CF)
    * Add reference (SO)
    (TODO, added)
  * Is the material sufficient? (SO)
    * Yes, the material is sufficient, but an illustration would probably be
      good (CF)
      (TODO, added)

* Implicit surfaces
  * Does one need to explain euclidean distance? (SO)
    * No, the term does not need to be explained as it is rather a standard
      term, but the notation may rather be (x^2 + y^2 + z^2)^{1/2} as this
      allows the usage of any basis, e.g. ln
      (TODO, added)
  * Equation (5.11) (CF)
    * Give an example by means of a sphere (CF)
    (TODO, added)
  * Functions for implicit surfaces (5.4.1) (CF)
    * Use an explanation of the signs as well when explaining the results (CF)
      (TODO, added)
  * Equation (5.15) (CF)
    * In the paragraph below the equation a sentence begins directly with a
      mathematical function. This is generally not a very good idea, so that
      sentence should be changed
      (DONE)

Citations
~~~~~~~~~~~

* Change the style of citations, which one can be decided later on (CF)
  (TODO)

Typography
~~~~~~~~~~

* Equation 5.1 (CF)
  * The notation of the word 'diffuse' is not nicely readable, as there is a
    gap between the to f letters which sould not be there. \text might solve
    this problem
    (DONE)

Further steps/proceedings (CF, SO)
----------------------------------

* Further steps planned are the introduction of a lighting model for implicit
  surfaces, the definition of the rendering itself, the introduction of basic
  operations on implicit surfaces as well as shadows. If time allows it,
  maybe a protoype is added. Is this alright? (SO)

  * Yes, absolutely, it is up to you, how far you are developing this project
    (CF)

TODO for the next meeting
=========================

* Present the current state of the work (SO)
* Discuss the current state of the work (CF, SO)
* Define further steps/proceeding (CF, SO)
* Define citation style (CF)
