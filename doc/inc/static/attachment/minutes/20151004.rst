Meeting minutes 2015-10-04
==========================

* External documents
  - Do external documents, e.g. papers, held in the project repository infringe copy rights? (CF)
    * Both are not entirely sure about the copy rights, so it is decided to share the documents only
      between both persons via Dropbox (CF and SO)

* Theoretical background
  - Phong equation
    * Why is the half way vector used (as described in Whitted's paper)
      instead of the more common usage of the angle (cosine) in direction of the light? (CF)
        - It is OK to use Whitted's originally proposed formula, as the results
          are the same for both formulas (CF)
        - Although the specular factor for the specular component is missing and has to be
          added (CF)

  - Structuring / procedure
    * Is the document structuring and are the plans for further development in good order? (SO)
      - The structuring of the document as well as the plans for further development are
        in a good order and the work may continue in the currently ongoing direction (CF)

* Literature
  - Is it somehow possible to get the second edition of "Computer graphics: principles and practice"? (SO)
    * Mr. Fuhrer possesses the mentioned book and proposes furthermore the lecture of a book dedicated to
      ray tracing which he also possesses. He will deposit both of the books on Monday, 5th of October 2015,
      in a room within the "Rolex" building of the Berne University of applied sciences in Biel (CF)

* Citations
  - Is the current way of citing in good order or do citations need to be more precise? (SO)
    * The way of citing is precise enough, the schemata is the following: (CF)
      - Source, [Chapter], Page(s)

* Document template
  - Remove currently used font "cmbright" as invoked to the usage of the LaTeX template of the Berne
    University of applied sciences (CF)
  - The lines shall be shortened so that they do not exceed 80 characters per line (CF)
  - The margins, especially the left and the right margins, shall be enlarged as they are currently
    very narrow (CF)

TODO for next meeting:
  * Present the current state of the work
  * Discuss the current state of the work
  * Define further steps/proceeding

Next meeting:
